        SCP-7814 is contained as an anomalous artifact under the custodianship of 
		PoI-7814-1 (Tsougkouris Okkotsis), employed as a containment specialist at Site-45, located in Fterikoudi, Cyprus.
        </p>
        <p>
        SCP-7814 is to remain in PoI-7814-1’s possession at all times. 
		Transfer of SCP-7814 to other individuals has demonstrated no anomalous effects and is not recommended 
		unless authorized by Site Command for testing purposes.
		</p>
        <p>
		No attempts are to be made to forcibly reactivate SCP-7814 or induce manifestation of 
		the associated anomalous entity (designated SCP-7814-A) without Level ██ approval.
		</p>
        <p>
		Psychological monitoring of PoI-7814-1 is mandatory, with emphasis 
		on stress response, identity displacement, and familial-role inferiority.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        SCP-7814 is a metal ring of unknown composition, formerly utilized as a containment and control medium 
		for an anomalous entity designated SCP-7814-A [informally referred to in archived documentation as “Rika”].
        </p>
        <p>
        SCP-7814-A is confirmed to have been created through unknown means by Georgios Okkotsis, former head of the Gojo Clan 
		and a long-term anomalous asset affiliated with the Foundation. During Georgios Okkotsis’ lifetime, SCP-7814-A was entirely stable, non-hostile, and responded exclusively
		to his direct commands via ██ ██ ██████ ██ ████████ █████. No containment breaches or deviations were recorded during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
        SCP-7814-A’s compliance parameters appear to have been uniquely attuned to Georgios Okkotsis. 
		No other individual has successfully interacted with or activated SCP-7814-A due to ██ ███████ █████████ ████ ███████.

        <h3>Addendum 7814-1: Succession Record</h3>
        <p>
        Prior to his death from natural causes, Georgios Okkotsis personally gifted SCP-7814 to his granddaughter, Georgia Okkotsis, as a familial keepsake
		and symbol of trust. At the time of transfer, SCP-7814 had already entered a state of reduced anomalous activity.
		</p>
        <p>
		Following Georgios Okkotsis’s death, SCP-7814 became completely inert. 
		No manifestations, responses, or detectable energy signatures associated with SCP-7814-A were recorded.
		</p>
        <p>
		Several months later, the Gojo Clan intervened and reassigned SCP-7814 from Georgia Okkotsis to her younger brother, Tsougkouris Okkotsis, citing
		internal evaluations classified under ██-██-██ that deemed him weaker than his sister in combat.
		</p>
        <p>
		Despite objections from both siblings, the Gojo Clan insisted that SCP-7814 remain with Tsougkouris Okkotsis, 
		designating it a protective charm rather than an operational artifact.
        </p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="section">
        <h3>Addendum 7814-2: Anomalous Effects on Pol-7814-1</h3>
        <p>
        SCP-7814 exhibits no anomalous properties when worn by individuals outside the Okkotsis bloodline.
		</p>
        <p>
		However, while in possession of SCP-7814, Tsougkouris Okkotsis demonstrates minor but repeatable deviations from human baseline, including:
		</p>
        <p>
		- Elevated physical endurance during containment incidents
		</p>
        <p>
		- Improved reaction timing under stress
		</p>
        <p>
		- Short-term strength amplification during high-risk scenarios
		</p>
        <p>
		These effects remain passive and limited in scope. SCP-7814-A has not manifested, communicated, or exerted independent agency.
		</p>
        <p>
		Current Foundation theory attributes these effects to residual imprinting and biological compatibility unique to Georgios Okkotsis’s direct descendants via ██ ███████ ██ █████████ ██ ██████.
        </p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="section">
        <h3>Addendum 7814-3: Employment at Site-45</h3>
        <p>
        Tsougkouris Okkotsis is currently employed as a containment specialist at Site-45, Fterikoudi, following Ethics Committee approval under Protocol ██-██.
		</p>
        <p>
		The committee’s ruling states: 
		“Continued proximity between PoI-7814-1 and SCP-7814 represents the most stable and lowest-risk containment configuration currently available.”
		</p>
        <p>
		PoI-7814-1 has not been briefed on SCP-7814-A’s prior operational role beyond general archival summaries and has never witnessed manifestation activity.
        </p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="section">
        <h3>Addendum 7814-4: Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>
        SCP-7814 remains classified as Safe due to its current inert state. However, reclassification to Neutralized has been denied due to the following factors:
		</p>
        <p>
		- Confirmed persistence of SCP-7814-A within the artifact
		</p>
        <p>
		- Absence of a known reactivation method due to ██ █████████ ███████
		</p>
        <p>
		- Genetic dependency on the Okkotsis lineage
		</p>
        <p>
		Historical precedent of SCP-7814-A’s effectiveness under Georgios Okkotsis remains ██ █████████.
		</p>
        <p>
		Predictive models indicate that SCP-7814-A, if reactivated, may not retain prior obedience parameters under ██ ███████ █████████.
        </p>

        <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
        <div class="quote">
            SCP-7814 is dormant. It is not neutralized. It remains where containment is
            most stable, in the hands of someone who was never meant to carry it.
